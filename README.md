# redux-funsies

Just a playground for me to experiment with Redux before implementing anything 
serious.

### Comleted Features
 - [X] Redux client-side application | [Branch: base](https://github.com/MorganCAw/redux-funsies/tree/base)
 - [X] Server-rendered Redux application | [Branch: server-render](https://github.com/MorganCAw/redux-funsies/tree/server-render)
 - [X] React-router-redux application | [Branch: react-router](https://github.com/MorganCAw/redux-funsies/tree/react-router)
 - [ ] Redux dev tooling (this will probably not happen anytime too soon)
